        <p><a target="_blank" href="http://uk.news.yahoo.com/millions-close-accounts-during-facebook-slump-103810937.html">Facebook is said to have suffered a second successive slump in users in America and Britain.</a>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Sky News reports that over the last month there has been a decline in Facebook users, particularly in Britain, and put this down to ‘Facebook fatigue’. Apparently the lack of new features and facial recognition has caused this. That’s not the case.</p>
        <p>What has happened is that millions of Facebook users, from the age of 16 to about 24, have hit exam season. I can only speak from a British perspective, but as soon as you hit 16 you have exams for every subsequent year of your educational life. And once you leave school and start university they only get harder and more important.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>About 5% of my Facebook friends deleted their accounts in the last month.</strong>&nbsp;Facebook is such a distraction to revision that many students delete their accounts during exam season. Of the UK’s 27.5 million users, about <a target="_blank" href="http://www.slideshare.net/amover/facebook-demographics-2011">30%</a> are between 16 and 24, and around 40% of 18-24 year olds will be at university. That’s around 3.5 million Facebook users in the UK alone who are taking exams, the vast majority of which occur in June. It is therefore not a stretch to say that around 3% of those taking exams will delete their accounts (remember deleted accounts can be reactivated in the future). And that leaves us with around 100,000 fewer British Facebook users, just as Sky News so gallantly reports.</p>
        <p>It would seem that this so called slump could just be the economic response of Facebook users to exam pressure, and it’s likely that this same article will be printed year after year…</p>
